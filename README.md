## Project Description:

Goal of this project is to compare Finland, Denmark, Switzerland, Canada and USA in following areas: unemployment, employment in agriculture, inflation, and mortality caused by road traffic injury for timespan of 20 years (2000 â€“ 2020). Data is extracted automatically through [World Bank Open Data indicators](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/) APIs. 
 Following is a description of each chart.

**Chart 1:** Percentage of labor force that is without work but available for and seeking employment.

**Chart 2:** Percentage of women vs men employed in agriculture. Sector of agriculture consists in activities such as hunting, forestry and fishing.

**Chart 3:** Percentage of inflation as measured by consumer price index.

**Chart 4:** Mortality caused by road traffic injury per 100,000 population.
